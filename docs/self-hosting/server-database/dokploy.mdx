# Deploying Server Database Version on Dokploy.

This article will detail how to deploy the server database version of LobeChat.

## 1. Preparation Work

### Configure S3 Storage Service

In the server-side database, we need to configure the S3 storage service to store files. For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the section [Configure S3 Storage Service](https://lobehub.com/docs/self-hosting/server-database/vercel#3-configure-s-3-storage-service) in the Vercel deployment guideã€‚After the configuration is complete, you will obtain the following environment variables:

```shell
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_ENDPOINT=
S3_BUCKET=
S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=
S3_ENABLE_PATH_STYLE=
```

### Configure the Clerk authentication service.

Obtain the three environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, and `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. For detailed configuration steps for Clerk, please refer to the section [Configure Authentication Service](https://lobehub.com/docs/self-hosting/server-database/vercel#2-configure-authentication-service) in the Vercel deployment guide.

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 2. Deploying the database on Dokploy

Enter the previously created Project, click on Create Service, and select Database. In the Database interface, choose PostgreSQL, then set the database name, user, and password. In the Docker image field, enter `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, and finally click Create to create the database.

Enter the created database and set an unused port in External Credentials to allow external access; otherwise, LobeChat will not be able to connect to the database. You can view the Postgres database connection URL in External Host, as shown below:

```shell
postgresql://postgres:wAbLxfXSwkxxxxxx@45.577.281.48:5432/postgres
```

Finally, click Deploy to deploy the database.
