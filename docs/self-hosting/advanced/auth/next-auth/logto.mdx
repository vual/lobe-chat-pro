# Configuring Logto Authentication Service

[Logto](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) is an open-source authentication service with a simple and beautiful interface, rich in features and easy to use. You can choose to use the official Logto Cloud or opt for a private deployment of Logto.

<Callout type={'tip'}>
  If you want to deploy Logto privately, we recommend using Docker Compose to deploy it together
  with the LobeChat database version. In this case, LobeChat can share the same Postgres instance
  with it.
</Callout>

## Logto Configuration Process

The following assumes your LobeChat database version domain is `https://lobe.example.com`.

If you are using a privately deployed Logto, assume its endpoint domain is `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com`.

If you are using Logto Cloud, assume its endpoint domain is `https://example.logto.app`.

<Steps>
  ### Create Logto Application

  Access your privately deployed Logto WebUI or [Logto Cloud](http://cloud.logto.io/) to enter the console, and create a `Next.js (App Router)` application under `Applications` with any name.

  ### Configure Logto

  Set the `Redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/api/auth/callback/logto` and the `Post sign-out redirect URI` to `https://lobe.example.com/`.

  Set `CORS allowed origins` to `https://lobe.example.com`.

  After successful creation, save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

  ### Configure Webhook (Optional)

  Configure the Logto Webhook so that LobeChat can receive notifications when user information is updated.

  Go to `Webhooks`, create a Webhook, and fill in the following fields:

  - Endpoint URL: `https://lobe.example.com/api/webhooks/logto`
  - Events: `User.Data.Updated`

  After successful creation, copy the Webhook's `Signing Key` and fill it in the `LOGTO_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.

  ### Configure Environment Variables

  <Image alt="Configure Environment Variables" inStep src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15af6d94-af4f-4aa9-bbab-7a46e9f9e837" />

  Set the obtained `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as `AUTH_LOGTO_ID` and `AUTH_LOGTO_SECRET` in the LobeChat environment variables.

  Configure `AUTH_LOGTO_ISSUER` in the LobeChat environment variables as follows:

  - `https://lobe-auth-api.example.com/oidc` if you are using a privately deployed Logto
  - `https://example.logto.app/oidc` if you are using Logto Cloud

  When deploying LobeChat, you need to configure the following environment variables:

  | Environment Variable        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
  | --------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET`          | Required | The key used to encrypt Auth.js session tokens. You can generate a key using the command: `openssl rand -base64 32`                                                                    |
  | `NEXT_AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS`   | Required | Select the single sign-on provider for LobeChat. For Logto, enter `logto`.                                                                                                             |
  | `AUTH_LOGTO_ID`             | Required | The Client ID from the Logto App details page                                                                                                                                          |
  | `AUTH_LOGTO_SECRET`         | Required | The Client Secret from the Logto App details page                                                                                                                                      |
  | `AUTH_LOGTO_ISSUER`         | Required | OpenID Connect issuer of the Logto provider                                                                                                                                            |
  | `NEXTAUTH_URL`              | Required | This URL specifies the callback address for Auth.js during OAuth verification, needed only if the default generated redirect address is incorrect. `https://lobe.example.com/api/auth` |
  | `LOGTO_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY` | Optional | The key used to verify the legality of Webhook requests sent by Logto.                                                                                                                 |

  </Callout>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the Logto deployment process, refer to the following common problems:

- `Only roles with the xxx attribute may create roles`: Check your database user's permissions and ensure that the user in your Logto database has the `admin` role to create roles.

- Error executing `logto db seed` on third-party databases like `Neon`: Try using the `logto db seed --encrypt-base-role` command.

- Database seeding failed: Try skipping the seeding process with the `--skip-seed` parameter.

- `Error: role xxx already exists`: Delete the existing role in the database.

- Database migration failed after a version upgrade: Try using the command `npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy $version` (e.g., `npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy 1.22.0`).

- I am using Docker deployment and want a one-click upgrade: Execute the custom command in the container: `sh -c "npm run cli db seed -- --swe --encrypt-base-role" && npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy $version && npm start`

<Callout type={'info'}>
  After successful deployment, users will be able to authenticate via Logto and use LobeChat.
