    You can fill in or modify Allowed Callback URLs after deployment, but make sure the filled URL is
    consistent with the deployed URL.

## Advanced Configuration

### Connecting to an Existing Single Sign-On Service

If your enterprise or organization already has a unified identity authentication infrastructure, you can connect to an existing single sign-on service in Applications -> SSO Integrations.

Auth0 supports single sign-on services such as Azure Active Directory, Slack, Google Workspace, Office 365, Zoom, and more. For a detailed list of supported services, please refer to [this link][auth0-sso-integrations].

<Image alt="Connecting to an Existing Single Sign-On Service" src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/30863298/9891347e-a338-4aa9-8714-f16c8dbcfcec" />

### Configuring Social Login

If your enterprise or organization needs to support external user logins, you can configure social login services in Authentication -> Social.

<Image alt="Configuring Social Login" src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/30863298/880749a6-5ba4-4e20-a968-b583a54de7fa" />

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  Configuring social login services by default allows anyone to authenticate, which may lead to
  LobeChat being abused by external users.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  If you need to restrict login users, be sure to configure a **blocking policy**: After enabling
  the social login option, refer to [this article][auth0-login-actions-manual] to create an Action
  to set up a blocking/allow list.
