Introducing a more natural and flexible way to chat with AI. With Branch Conversations, your discussions can flow in multiple directions, just like human conversations do. Create new conversation branches from any message, giving you the freedom to explore different paths while preserving the original context.

Choose between two powerful modes:

- **Continuation Mode:** Seamlessly extend your current discussion while maintaining valuable context
- **Standalone Mode:** Start fresh with a new topic based on any previous message

This groundbreaking feature transforms linear conversations into dynamic, tree-like structures, enabling deeper exploration of ideas and more productive interactions.
