# Visual Model User Guide

The ecosystem of large language models that support visual recognition is becoming increasingly rich. Starting from `gpt-4-vision`, LobeChat now supports various large language models with visual recognition capabilities, enabling LobeChat to have multimodal interaction capabilities.

## Image Input

If the model you are currently using supports visual recognition, you can input image content by uploading a file or dragging the image directly into the input box. The model will automatically recognize the image content and provide feedback based on your prompts.

## Visual Models

In the model list, models with a `üëÅÔ∏è` icon next to their names indicate that the model supports visual recognition. Selecting such a model allows you to send image content.

## Custom Model Configuration

If you need to add a custom model that is not currently in the list and explicitly supports visual recognition, you can enable the `Visual Recognition` feature in the `Custom Model Configuration` to allow the model to interact with images.
