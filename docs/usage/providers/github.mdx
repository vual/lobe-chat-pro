# Using GitHub Models in LobeChat

<Image cover src={'https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3050839a-cb16-485d-8bae-1bc2f9ade632'} />

[GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is a new feature recently launched by GitHub, designed to provide developers with a free platform to access and experiment with various AI models. GitHub Models offers an interactive sandbox environment where users can test different model parameters and prompts, and observe the responses of the models. The platform supports advanced language models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Meta's Llama 3.1, and Mistral's Large 2, covering a wide range of applications from large-scale language models to task-specific models.

This article will guide you on how to use GitHub Models in LobeChat.

## Rate Limits for GitHub Models

Currently, the usage of the Playground and free API is subject to limits on the number of requests per minute, the number of requests per day, the number of tokens per request, and the number of concurrent requests. If you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait for the limit to reset before making further requests. The rate limits vary for different models (low, high, and embedding models). For model type information, please refer to the GitHub Marketplace.

    - During the testing phase of GitHub Models, users must apply to join the [waitlist](https://github.com/marketplace/models/waitlist/join) in order to gain access.

    - Please store the access token securely, as it will only be displayed once. If you accidentally lose it, you will need to create a new token.
