    Safely store the key from the pop-up as it will only appear once. If you accidentally lose it, you
    will need to create a new key.

  ### Configure Groq in LobeChat

  You can find the Groq configuration option in `Settings` -> `Language Model`, where you can input the API Key you just obtained.
