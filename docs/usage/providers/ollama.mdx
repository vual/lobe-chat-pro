# Using Ollama in LobeChat

<Image alt={'Using Ollama in LobeChat'} borderless cover src={'https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/17870709/f579b39b-e771-402c-a1d1-620e57a10c75'} />

Ollama is a powerful framework for running large language models (LLMs) locally, supporting various language models including Llama 2, Mistral, and more. Now, LobeChat supports integration with Ollama, meaning you can easily enhance your application by using the language models provided by Ollama in LobeChat.

This document will guide you on how to use Ollama in LobeChat:

## Using Ollama on macOS

<Steps>
  ### Local Installation of Ollama

  [Download Ollama for macOS](https://ollama.com/download?utm_source=lobehub\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_campaign=download-macos) and unzip/install it.

  ### Configure Ollama for Cross-Origin Access

  Due to Ollama's default configuration, which restricts access to local only, additional environment variable setting `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is required for cross-origin access and port listening. Use `launchctl` to set the environment variable:

  ```bash
  launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
  ```

  After setting up, restart the Ollama application.

</Steps>

## Using Ollama on Windows

<Steps>
  ### Local Installation of Ollama

  [Download Ollama for Windows](https://ollama.com/download?utm_source=lobehub\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_campaign=download-windows) and install it.

  ### Configure Ollama for Cross-Origin Access

  Since Ollama's default configuration allows local access only, additional environment variable setting `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is needed for cross-origin access and port listening.

  On Windows, Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.

  1. First, exit the Ollama program by clicking on it in the Windows taskbar.
  2. Edit system environment variables from the Control Panel.
  3. Edit or create the Ollama environment variable `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` for your user account, setting the value to `*`.
  4. Click `OK/Apply` to save and restart the system.
  5. Run `Ollama` again.

## Using Ollama on Linux

<Steps>
  ### Local Installation of Ollama

  Install using the following command:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```

  Alternatively, you can refer to the [Linux manual installation guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md).

  ### Configure Ollama for Cross-Origin Access

  Due to Ollama's default configuration, which allows local access only, additional environment variable setting `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is required for cross-origin access and port listening. If Ollama runs as a systemd service, use `systemctl` to set the environment variable:

  1. Edit the systemd service by calling `sudo systemctl edit ollama.service`:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl edit ollama.service
  ```

  2. Add `Environment` under `[Service]` for each environment variable:

  ```bash
  [Service]
  Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
  Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
  ```

  3. Save and exit.
  4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart ollama
  ```

## Deploying Ollama using Docker

<Steps>
  ### Pulling Ollama Image

  If you prefer using Docker, Ollama provides an official Docker image that you can pull using the following command:

  ```bash
  docker pull ollama/ollama
  ```

  ### Configure Ollama for Cross-Origin Access

  Since Ollama's default configuration allows local access only, additional environment variable setting `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is needed for cross-origin access and port listening.

  If Ollama runs as a Docker container, you can add the environment variable to the `docker run` command.

  ```bash
  docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -e OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
  ```

## Installing Ollama Models

Ollama supports various models, which you can view in the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) and choose the appropriate model based on your needs.

### Installation in LobeChat

In LobeChat, we have enabled some common large language models by default, such as llama3, Gemma, Mistral, etc. When you select a model for conversation, we will prompt you to download that model.
