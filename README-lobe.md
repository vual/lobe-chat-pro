[![][image-feat-database]][docs-feat-database]

### `12` [Support Local / Remote Database][docs-feat-database]

LobeChat supports the use of both server-side and local databases. Depending on your needs, you can choose the appropriate deployment solution:

- **Local database**: suitable for users who want more control over their data and privacy protection. LobeChat uses CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) technology to achieve multi-device synchronization. This is an experimental feature aimed at providing a seamless data synchronization experience.
- **Server-side database**: suitable for users who want a more convenient user experience. LobeChat supports PostgreSQL as a server-side database. For detailed documentation on how to configure the server-side database, please visit [Configure Server-side Database](https://lobehub.com/docs/self-hosting/advanced/server-database).

Regardless of which database you choose, LobeChat can provide you with an excellent user experience.

[![][image-feat-auth]][docs-feat-auth]

### `13` [Support Multi-User Management][docs-feat-auth]

LobeChat supports multi-user management and provides two main user authentication and management solutions to meet different needs:

- **next-auth**: LobeChat integrates `next-auth`, a flexible and powerful identity verification library that supports multiple authentication methods, including OAuth, email login, credential login, etc. With `next-auth`, you can easily implement user registration, login, session management, social login, and other functions to ensure the security and privacy of user data.

- [**Clerk**](https://go.clerk.com/exgqLG0): For users who need more advanced user management features, LobeChat also supports `Clerk`, a modern user management platform. `Clerk` provides richer functions, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), user profile management, login activity monitoring, etc. With `Clerk`, you can get higher security and flexibility, and easily cope with complex user management needs.

Regardless of which user management solution you choose, LobeChat can provide you with an excellent user experience and powerful functional support.

[![][image-feat-pwa]][docs-feat-pwa]

### `14` [Progressive Web App (PWA)][docs-feat-pwa]

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment.
Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application ([PWA](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361)) technology,
a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, LobeChat can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining its lightweight and high-performance characteristics.
Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps,
providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add LobeChat as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:
>
> - Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> - Visit the LobeChat webpage.
> - In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the <kbd>Install</kbd> icon.
> - Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

[![][image-feat-mobile]][docs-feat-mobile]

### `15` [Mobile Device Adaptation][docs-feat-mobile]

We have carried out a series of optimization designs for mobile devices to enhance the user's mobile experience. Currently, we are iterating on the mobile user experience to achieve smoother and more intuitive interactions. If you have any suggestions or ideas, we welcome you to provide feedback through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

[![][image-feat-theme]][docs-feat-theme]

### `16` [Custom Themes][docs-feat-theme]

As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeChat places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences,
hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime.
Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences.
Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in LobeChat.

> \[!TIP]
>
> The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system.
> For users who like to manually control details, LobeChat also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.

### `*` What's more

Beside these features, LobeChat also have much better basic technique underground:

- [x] üí® **Quick Deployment**: Using the Vercel platform or docker image, you can deploy with just one click and complete the process within 1 minute without any complex configuration.
- [x] üåê **Custom Domain**: If users have their own domain, they can bind it to the platform for quick access to the dialogue agent from anywhere.
- [x] üîí **Privacy Protection**: All data is stored locally in the user's browser, ensuring user privacy.
- [x] üíé **Exquisite UI Design**: With a carefully designed interface, it offers an elegant appearance and smooth interaction. It supports light and dark themes and is mobile-friendly. PWA support provides a more native-like experience.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel, Zeabur , Sealos or Alibaba Cloud

"If you want to deploy this service yourself on Vercel, Zeabur or Alibaba Cloud, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

<div align="center">

|           Deploy with Vercel            |                     Deploy with Zeabur                      |                     Deploy with Sealos                      |                       Deploy with RepoCloud                       |                         Deploy with Alibaba Cloud                         |

#### After Fork

After fork, only retain the upstream sync action and disable other actions in your repository on GitHub.

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating "updates available." This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

> \[!TIP]
>
> We suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [üìò Auto Sync With Latest][docs-upstream-sync]

<br/>

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The plugin system is currently undergoing major development. You can learn more in the following issues:
>
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 1**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/73): Implement separation of the plugin from the main body, split the plugin into an independent repository for maintenance, and realize dynamic loading of the plugin.
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 2**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/97): The security and stability of the plugin's use, more accurately presenting abnormal states, the maintainability of the plugin architecture, and developer-friendly.
> - [x] [**Plugin Phase 3**](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/149): Higher-level and more comprehensive customization capabilities, support for plugin authentication, and examples.
